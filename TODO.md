# TODO

- Put the contents of this file somewhere better suited
- Add back-ticks '`' as string delimiters
- Check edge-cases for matches that don't use `\b` as delimiters;
- Make highlighting togglable by category (Constructors, Operators);
  - If I can make that, put back variables, with highlighting disabled by default;
- Modularize the grammar in multiple files - Doesn't look possible?;
