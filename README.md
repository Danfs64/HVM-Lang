# HVM-Lang

This extension provides basic highlighting to files written in the [HVM](https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM) language.

## Features

The highlighting so far includes:

- keywords (`let`)
- constructor names;
- comments;
- literals such as strings and numbers;
- variables (subject to removal).

## Known Issues

- Dot-separated constructor names are kinda wonky;

## Release Notes
