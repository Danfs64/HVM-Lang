# HVM-Lang

This extension provides basic highlighting to files written in the [HVM](https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM) language.

## Features

The highlighting so far includes:

- keywords (`let`, `dup`, `@` and `λ`)
- constructor names;
- comments;
- literals such as strings, characters and numbers;

## How to Install/Use

You can either:

- Install it directly from VSCode Marketplace; or
- Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Danfs64/HVM-Lang/releases) and install it using the command: `code --install-extension <path-to-vsix-file>`; or
- Clone this repository, open it with VSCode, and press F5. This will open a new VSCode instance with the extension running. Since the instance is ephemeral, you would need to do this every time you want to use the extension, making this method not recommended for continuous use.

## Known Issues
